        Hello! I'm Mika Ervin, a passionate non-binary individual with a love for animation. Cartoons and animated films have always held a special place in my heart. From Coraline to Prince of Egypt, Beetlejuice, Steven Universe, Ed, Edd, N' Eddy, Bob's Burgers, Futurama, Archer, Arcane, and many more, I've been enthralled by their creative magic. But it's not just the animation that captivates me; I also deeply appreciate the role of music in these works, despite my limited musical knowledge.

        In 2017, I embraced art as a serious hobby and even had the chance to work on commissioned projects. However, I soon realized that I yearned for greater fulfillment. This realization led me to make a life-changing decisionâ€”to pursue a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Animation. I graduated from Villa Maria College of Buffalo, equipped with the skills and knowledge to bring my artistic visions to life through animation.
